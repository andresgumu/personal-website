### A Realization

Everyone has heard of the saying, "Jack of all trades, master of none", but rarely hears the end, arguably the most important part too, "but better than master of one". 

It's overwhelming, living in this age of instantaneous information: libraries filled with millions of strategically placed words, each with their own agenda to push or information to spread. That, and our portable computers in our pockets, capable of making people millions of dollars or destroying the mental health of young adults. So it is clear that *what* we do with what we're given determines the direction of our growth. So why do people fail? Why do people quit? Everyone wants growth right?

Right, but growth in a different type of way. Sideways growth, where it appears you are making progress in your life, when in reality you are in the same place making the same choices, but older. Upwards growth, where you build off of visible results, you take charge, learn from failures, and you keep pushing forward. Or downwards growth, letting your external reality affect your future reality. Repeatedly making decisions that confirm your bias and fuel your poor decision-making, leading you down a rabbit hole that is not easy to get out of. 

Everyone has been involved in at least one of these types. I am a prime example as a college engineering student. Stereotypes have been pushed onto me, I have "learned" to work harder and study for longer periods of time, I have failed and convinced myself briefly that I didn't have what it took to become an engineer. My first semester, I was sitting in this perpetual state of educational insecurity, career indecisiveness, and imposter syndrome-esque environment that destroyed my will to learn and grow as a undergraduate student. 

But what if you or I suddenly became the type of person that stopped falling short of their own expectations? What if everything came easy, nothing was a hard-fought battle? Would I want that for myself? Would you?

### A New Perspective

At first, it may be wonderful. You seem infinitely ahead of other students academically or it can also be that your expectations are lower and more easily achievable. 

But life is not a numbers game. You don't win by tallying up all the things you have achieved. You win by *genuinely loving the person you become*. You find being ahead is wonderful because it is effortless, it is easy, but at what cost? If all you ever had to do was read a passage of a book once to understand it or take one practice exam to prepare yourself for an upcoming final, where would you practice discipline? Persistence? 

It is appealing to look at the positively prospective "what ifs" because somewhere in your mind there is a blockage of sorts that does not allow you to see your situation for what it really is. It's nice to think that maybe someday hardship will leave your life as quickly as a blink of an eye, but would you genuinely enjoy living the rest of your days completely frictionless?

It may seem at first that you have absolutely nothing to gain from investing more and more time into your studies and thus giving up hobbies you once enjoyed doing, or sacrificing a portion of your college years to learn the most challenging subjects and topics. 

But slowly and *surely*, there will come a point in your life, as already happened in mine recently, where you come to accept your place academically, mentally and even physically. 

### The Right Type of Growth

Adversity is a noun that screams unfavorable, unfortunate, and stressful. It is an entity everyone must face.
