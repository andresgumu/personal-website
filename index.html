              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                As an undergraduate General Engineering student, I'm passionate
                about exploring the intersection of hardware and software, with
                aspirations to specialize in Computer or Electrical Engineering.
                The complexity of modern computing really interests me - from
                intricate circuit designs to the embedded systems
                that power our world. While building a foundation through
                courses in calculus, physics, and chemistry, I've discovered my
                love for hands-on learning through personal projects. <br><br>This
                website itself represents my journey into front-end development,
                and you'll find various side projects here that have deepened my
                understanding of electrical engineering. I believe in taking
                creative approaches to technical challenges and never shy away
                from experimenting with new ideas. When I'm not diving into
                engineering projects, you'll often find me the pages of
                a good book - currently, I'm particularly moved by John
                Steinbeck's 'East of Eden' for its profound exploration of human
                nature and family dynamics.
